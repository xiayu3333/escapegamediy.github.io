# Letter Combination Word Generator

## Overview

The **Letter Combination Word Generator** is a simple web application that allows users to input a set of letters and generates all possible words that can be formed using those letters. The generated words are sorted by length and alphabetically.

## Files

This project contains the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that provides the user interface for the application.
- `freq-word.txt`: A text file containing a list of commonly used words, which serves as the word database for the generator.

## Features

- Input a set of letters to generate possible words.
- Words are sorted by length, with shorter words appearing first.
- Words of the same length are sorted alphabetically.
